{"name":"Neat","tagline":"Empirical analysis of ionised nebulae, with uncertainty propagation","body":"NEAT (Nebular empirical analysis tool) is a code for calculating chemical abundances from emission line spectra of photoionised nebulae. It is designed to be very simple but to return robust and meaningful results. It has been used to determine abundances and conditions for several samples of ionized nebulae (e.g. <a href=\"http://cdsads.u-strasbg.fr/abs/2011MNRAS.418.2532S\">Stock et al, 2011</a>) and also as a testbed for investigating uncertainties (e.g. <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012MNRAS.422.3516W\">Wesson et al, 2012</a>)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
